truth-tables
============
Made for Elaine Rich for use by her students and anyone else who needs help learning boolean logic.

There are two main modes: Practice and Testing. 

Practice mode
=============
Allows you to see your mistakes as you go (highlighted in red) and correct them. 

Running in practice mode:
-------------------------
Open truth tables in a new window

    make run

and append onto the end of web address some boolean expression ([EXPRESSION]) you want to practice and set test to false. The address should take the form

    index.html?[EXPRESSION]?test=false

Example: 
index.html?a|b?test=false

Testing mode
============
Marks and counts mistakes after you press 'submit' at the bottom of the page.

Running in testing mode:
-------------------------
Open truth tables in a new window

    make run

and append onto the end of web address some boolean expression ([EXPRESSION]) you want to practice and set test to true. The address should take the form

    index.html?[EXPRESSION]?test=true

Example: 
index.html?a|b?test=true
